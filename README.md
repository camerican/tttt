# TackyTicTacToe
## A Code Test

This project is a **Code Test** for a prospective employer built over 6 hours (1/15-1/16/15) implementing a TicTacToe game.  An example of this project can be viewed at http://minnirok.com/tictactoe/

### Technical Requirements

* Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game
* Two people play using the same KVM

### How to View this Program

**Tacky TicTacToe** is a front-end javascript prototype satisfying the above requirements. It should be viewed as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) rather than a polished diamond.  This approach was decided upon to emphasize the utility of developing features **in-code** to evaluate their utility rather than via external specification. This exploratory approach makes problem-solving more fun since the creativity rests with the developer and not the person scoping the project.

This particular project could certainly stand to be refactored but should provide insight as to an agile approach towards realizing an objective.

### Rules of TicTacToe

**Tic Tac Toe** is a turn-based game where two players compete on a 3x3 grid. Each players alternate choosing squares on the grid to claim. The player who aligns three of his/her pieces in a row first wins. The game ends in a draw if there is no winner after the grid is full.

### Program Features

* Player turns are tracked automatically
* Players click the boxes they wish to move in
* The type of victory (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) is detected, or tie
* Winning lines are drawn visually
* Wins for each player are tallied
* The game may be reset after each game finishes
* Players may change their gamepiece symbol (from one of 11 options)
* No images are used in project (gamepieces are rendered in FontAwesome) 

### Languages

The following web languages are used:

* JavaScript (js)
* Cascading Style Sheets (css)
* HyperText Markup Language (html)

### Dependencies

This repository depends upon the following libraries/resources:

* JQuery 1.10.2
* Font Awesome 4.2.0
